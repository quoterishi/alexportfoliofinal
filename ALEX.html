<h2 id="about me" align="center"><B>ABOUT ME </B></h2>
<P><h5 style="font-family:'Arial' ;text-align: justify; text-align: center;"> Hi I am Alex The web designer ,I work with many small businesses to create websites that 
help them stand out from their competitors. My favorite websites focus on simplicity and use a lot of 
white space, creative copy, and beautiful graphics. You can see some examples of the work I have 
done on my portfolio page. A brief background on my upbringing: My parents own a small business 
and I learned a lot about business from them. I learned to think about business. This knowledge base 
is very important. It gives me the tools to understand the business behind the websites I create and 
helps me see opportunities that others may not. I've never created a website before. Before I started 
web design, my life was fun. For over three years, I've taught ESL in Korea, picked apples in New 
Zealand, traded agricultural products and currencies, observed new products, and traveled the 
world. I continue to benefit from these experiences in my work and life. </h5></P>

</header>
<p><h4 style="text-align: justify; text-align: center;">We designed a website for Safet ,who is a developer and wanted a classic structure of an 
introductory line + nice photo of himself in his website . He also wanted a contact button as a call to 
action, which is very smart as it directs website’s visitors to their next step when interacting with 
him.
After listing his skills, he also wanted to give recruiters the opportunity to download an 
updated version of his CV with a button click. </h4></p>

</header>
<p><h4 style="text-align: justify; text-align: center;">Ben wanted to display his skills as images and, most of all, he wanted all his projects list a 
live link to test the final result, allowing recruiters to visualize his work without having to pull down 
the project from GitHub. </h4></p>
